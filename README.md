## Hackathon 2020

Starting by thanking the Lord. Patience is the key.
During 96 hours,  based on 
Innovative Tools on Extractive Industries Transparency in Burkina Faso, the competition was held in an Structure named Switch Maker near the US. Embassy.
At first, 10 teams were selected. Nine teams held on till the finals. Pretty much without sleep, pertinents solutions were supposed to be given in that short time. It was getting intense cause we were consulting the same coaches, the same books. And like always three groups were winners. 
Among the three, our group named Maze, ends up with the first place with an average of 16/20. Thank you Lord for assisting us.
